# TODO
- [X] Implement all the losses and  replicate figure 9
- [X] Implement new method and compare
- [ ] Write algorithm on overleaf and share it 
- [X] look for a another dataset
- [ ] Merge the create dataset with Julian's. Note that he has a 'good_data' file. 
- [ ] Look for the 0.5 multiplier and fix it
- [ ] Look into the sparse multiplication
- [ ] Add Sampling
